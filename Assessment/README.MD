# Programming Foundations Assessment

This was a small project for my Programming Foundations class at college. The initial requirements were set by the SQA.

Before completing I expanded the project a little in order to improve my own skills.

# Will update in the future with the SQA document detailing the requirements and by expanding this readme to include instructions and some explanations.
